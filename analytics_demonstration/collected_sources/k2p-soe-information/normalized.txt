KNOW THE THREATS
Online child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) continues to evolve with increased violence targeting kids and teens online.
In 2025, criminal activity associated with Sadistic Online Exploitation (SOE) increased drastically.
According to the Department of Homeland Security, SOE networks are online groups that share and spread violent real-life media, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), murder, suicide, rape, incest, self-harm, arson, doxxing, swatting, animal cruelty and suicide.
Online predators in these networks target and exploit minor and vulnerable populations and use threats, peer pressure, blackmail and manipulation to force kids and teens to engage in behaviors they would not normally do or leverage behaviors they already exhibit to create this violent content.
These SOE networks, referred to as “communities” or “the com” by the people involved, operate across international borders and function through leadership roles and hierarchy.
Since they operate through online platforms, they can exploit and abuse kids and teens anywhere in the world.
In 2024, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s CyberTipline received over 1,300 reports related to violent online groups — a more than 200% increase from 2024 and over 1,500% increase since 2022.
SOE networks use various methods to attract victims, often targeting vulnerable individuals related to self-harm, depression, eating disorders and mental health.
They also engage with kids and teens on social media and gaming platforms, using violent content to lure them to more anonymous platforms for extreme content and extortion.
SOE groups often overlap with other adjacent groups who may inadvertently stumble upon SOE groups.
After befriending victims, these online predators request explicit images, self-harm, animal cruelty and violent or antisemitic content, then use this to extort victims into creating more extreme material.
These communities are not limited to adults preying on minors — but often include peer-on-peer crimes as well.
Kids and teens are targeting others, using similar adult predator methodology, and it is often overlooked as “kids being kids.”

According to Homeland Security Investigations forensic interview specialists, many kids and teens report that they are directly seeking these communities online, which is different than being directly targeted by adults.
In these situations, once part of “the com,” they become desensitized to violent online content and the coercion they undergo appears more like a trust building exercise than one of threat and force.
Additionally, the victim-to-perpetrator pipeline is very prevalent in these groups; kids and teens may start out as victims and then become perpetrators of these crimes.
In 2024, law enforcement officers estimated that SOE networks comprised hundreds of members.
CVLT: Pronounced “cult,” a neo-Nazi child exploitation network founded in 2019.
CVLT: Creator coerced minors to self-generate CSAM and had victims carve his name into their skin to create a permanent scar (branding / cut signs / fan signs / blood signs).
CVLT: Group has disbanded and is no longer active, but references to it are still made online.
764: Global online exploitation group created in 2021 by a teen living in Texas.
764: Started as a peer-to-peer network and still primarily involves youth-on-youth acts, but includes adult acts against children/teens and teen-on-adult acts as members have aged.
764: Many subgroup names fall under 764.
764: Members exploit victims (often with mental health challenges) through peer pressure and fear to gain control and coerce risky and often illegal behavior.
764: Host online “watch parties” or “cut shows” to celebrate and share harmful acts via livestream; may also be called “cut stages” or “stages.”
HSI has been working tirelessly, along with other law enforcement agencies, to protect children and teens from these groups and individuals.

Tactics used by SOE networks
Manipulation tactics to engage in violence: pressure someone and make them feel they have no choice; common on apps with group chats, online scams, gaming and other social media.
Threats or violence used to intimidate: use violence or the threat of violence to scare someone into doing something they wouldn’t normally do, such as self-harm, swatting, or doxxing.
Online Grooming: process where an online predator establishes a connection, gains trust, gathers personal information, desensitizes to sexual content, and exploits vulnerabilities; predators may pretend to be minors and coerce more graphic content; with SOE, grooming evolves for broader coercion/trust building/victimization.
Self-harm: hurting one’s own body on purpose without suicidal intent; includes cutting, burning, biting, scratching, picking at wounds/scabs, pulling out hair, punching/hitting body.
Branding: indication of membership/submission/acceptance; mark or symbol burned/etched/carved to create permanent scar; also “cut signs” or “blood signs”; marks written on a person also called “fan signs.”
Traditional Sextortion: online predator threatens/blackmails victim into providing sexually explicit content; threatens to share content publicly.
Financial Sextortion: demands money or gift cards in exchange for keeping sexual content private; rare with SOE.
Sadistic Sextortion: threatens victim to undergo suffering/submission through violence, self-harm or destruction for sadistic/sinister purposes, often coordinated through organized SOE networks.
Cyberbullying: bullying conducted on digital devices; used to hurt, threaten or embarrass others online; may cross into unlawful/criminal behavior; on the rise with SOE networks.

VIRAL CHALLENGES SPREAD THROUGH ONLINE EXPLOITATION ENTERPRISES
Global online exploitation enterprises include challenges that spread on social media platforms, such as the “Blackout Challenge” or the “Tide Pod Challenge.”
These challenges use peer pressure and group intimidation to coerce kids and teens into risky or harmful behavior they would not otherwise do.
(Privacy note: the brochure names a specific deceased 12-year-old; this example KG does not model victim identity.)
Bloomberg reported that in an 18-month period, the Blackout Challenge caused at least 20 deaths; 15 to children ages 12 and under; and at least 5 children between ages 13 and 14.
Tips2Identify involvement in SOE (possible indicators a child/teen may be in danger):
Indicator: Self-harm in the form of symbols or characters, including carving it or writing on themselves.
Indicator: Interest in Neo-Nazi symbology.
Indicator: Increased attention or obsession with mass attackers or mass shooters.
Indicator: Interest in satanic symbology.
Indicator: Use of alphanumeric nomenclature in names or symbols.
Indicator: Scars, often in patterns.
Indicator: Fresh cuts, scratches, bruises, bite marks, burns or other wounds.
Indicator: Writing in blood or what appears to be blood.
Indicator: Suicidal ideations.
Indicator: Lack of empathy or acting as if they don’t believe in anything (religions, morals, love, code of conduct or rules).
Indicator: Harming pets or other animals or animals suddenly fearing the child/teen.
Indicator: Law enforcement being called to your home under false pretenses such as doxxing or swatting events.
Indicator: Random occurrences at your address such as unexpected deliveries (a form of swatting without law enforcement involvement meant to harass).

HOW2RESPOND
Take immediate action if you know or suspect a child or teen is a victim of online CSEA.
Remain calm (helps deescalate).
Take the device offline (airplane mode) so content cannot be remotely erased/deleted/altered.
Save all communication — do not delete (important evidence).
Do not initiate contact with the “friends”, network or community in question; ignore communication.
Contact law enforcement and allow them access to all information, including devices.
Do not send images from the child’s or teen’s device to any other device (illegal to disseminate CSAM).
HOW2REPORT
Call the Know2Protect Tipline at 833-591-KNOW (5669); information is reviewed and referred to HSI field offices for potential investigation.
Contact local, state or tribal law enforcement officials directly; in an emergency, call 911.
Submit a CyberTipline report with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at report.cybertip.org.
