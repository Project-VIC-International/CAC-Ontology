When a child goes missing, time matters. The first hours can determine whether a child is quickly located or drawn deeper into harm. Yet the nature of these cases has changed dramatically in recent years, driven by technology, social media and online grooming.

According to Kevin Branzetti, cofounder and CEO of the National Child Protection Task Force (NCPTF), many law enforcement agencies are confronting challenges that did not exist a decade ago.

“Technology has changed how children are groomed and exploited,” Branzetti said. “Offenders don’t rely on physical proximity anymore. They build trust online first, long before a child ever leaves home.”

NCPTF exists to help law enforcement bridge the gap between rapidly evolving technology and the practical realities of missing-child investigations, providing free case assistance and operational support focused on locating endangered children as quickly as possible.

Rethinking the “runaway” label

One area where NCPTF works closely with agencies is how runaway cases are understood.

Children who run away — especially repeatedly — face significantly higher risks of exploitation, trafficking and violence. Yet labeling a case as a “runaway” can unintentionally reduce urgency and limit investigative momentum.

“When a child leaves home, it’s often seen as a behavioral issue or a family problem,” Branzetti said. “But for many of these kids, running away is a symptom of something deeper — abuse, neglect, coercion or online grooming.”

Research consistently shows that runaway children are among the most vulnerable populations to traffickers and exploiters. Once on the street, their survival needs make them easy targets for manipulation and control.

Another challenge is what happens after a child is located.

“Law enforcement is usually successful at finding the child,” Branzetti said. “But preventing it from happening again requires more than a police response. It takes schools, social workers, nonprofits and families working together.”

Steps for breaking the cycle

Based on NCPTF’s work with agencies across the country, Branzetti highlights several key principles for improving outcomes in missing-child cases.

- Recognize offender tactics: “These offenders are deliberate,” Branzetti said. “They coach kids to shut down accounts, abandon devices and avoid being tracked. They understand how investigations work.”
- Understand how technology is used: “Most of these kids have online lives their parents don’t fully see,” Branzetti said. “There are the accounts adults know about — and the ones kids keep hidden.”
- Align policies with today’s reality: Procedures should reflect the role technology plays in modern exploitation. Social media, messaging apps and online gaming platforms are often part of the grooming process.
- Act with urgency: The faster a child is located, the greater the chance of preventing exploitation or serious harm.
- Recognize the risk: Runaway cases should never be treated as low priority. Every missing child faces heightened risk, regardless of age or circumstances.

Using legal tools effectively in missing-child cases

Modern missing-child investigations require investigators to understand both technology and the legal tools available to act quickly. Two of the most important tools in time-sensitive cases are Emergency Disclosure Requests (EDRs) and search warrants.

Emergency Disclosure Requests (EDRs)

Under federal law, electronic service providers may disclose information to law enforcement when they believe there is an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury. These requests are most effective when investigators clearly articulate the imminent risk facing the child.

“In many cases, officers hesitate to use emergency disclosures because they’re unsure whether they have legal authority,” Branzetti said. “What we focus on is helping investigators understand that a missing child — including a teenager — can meet the threshold of imminent danger and that they must clearly explain why in their request.”

Effective emergency requests should make clear that a missing child is an endangered child, regardless of age or the circumstances of the disappearance. As time passes, the risks of exploitation, criminal involvement, addiction and violence increase dramatically. Requests must explain why waiting for standard legal process would expose the child to greater harm and why immediate disclosure is necessary. The clearer the threat is articulated, the more likely providers are to respond quickly and completely.

Search warrants

Search warrants present a different challenge. In most jurisdictions, search warrants are tied to criminal statutes, and being missing is not, in itself, a crime. As a result, investigators often rely on related offenses — such as child endangerment or endangering the welfare of a child — to establish probable cause when seeking digital or physical evidence in a missing-child case.

“Many agencies are doing the best they can with the laws they have,” Branzetti said. “If your jurisdiction doesn’t clearly provide a path to seek a warrant in these cases, that’s something leadership should address proactively with prosecutors and legislators — because telling families we can’t act is unacceptable.”

Agencies benefit from working closely with their legal advisers and district attorneys to develop consistent approaches to missing-child warrants and from advocating for statutory frameworks that reflect the investigative realities of endangered-missing cases.

NCPTF’s role

NCPTF provides free investigative support to law enforcement agencies working missing, exploited or trafficked child cases. Its Missing Child Rescue Operations (MCROs) bring together law enforcement, social workers, nonprofits and technology partners in a coordinated, multi-day operational environment focused on active cases.

Recent operations have resulted in dozens of missing children being located, while also strengthening long-term collaboration among participating agencies.

“We bring people into the same room and work the cases together,” Branzetti said. “For many departments, navigating legal process or platform requests is challenging at first. But once they see what’s possible, it changes how they approach future cases.”

Find. Listen. Help.

NCPTF operates under a guiding framework it calls “Find-Listen-Help.” Law enforcement locates the child. Then social workers, families and community partners address the underlying issues that led the child to leave in the first place.

“Every time a child runs away, it’s a cry for help,” Branzetti said. “Our responsibility as adults is not just to bring them home but to understand why they left and make it safer for them to stay.”
