### Phase -1 Summary

- **Duplicate detection**: no exact URL match found in repo; proceeded with collection.
- **Acquisition constraint**: automated fetch blocked by device verification; used an in-session web snapshot excerpt.
- **Harm minimization**: retained only non-graphic, high-level statements; avoided storing explicit descriptions.
- **Artifacts created**:
  - `source.txt` (SHA-256: `16ba10c3e56c2a1167b66fda28dfb0b409d7c8afdcb507cf70603160cdc8259f`)
  - `normalized.txt` (SHA-256: `64c47e0c3472cab4de099cb5e04a1fd9c734c66f303473dba204c13dd67f4beb`)
  - `manifest.yaml`, `skeleton.ttl`

### Excluded Topics (none)

- Sensitive explicit content was excluded; provenance + high-level semantics retained.
