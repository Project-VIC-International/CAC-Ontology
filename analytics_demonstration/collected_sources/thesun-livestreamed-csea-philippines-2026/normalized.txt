Published: 2026-02-15 (The Sun) — livestreamed CSEA / “made to order” framing
Normalization note: Harm-minimized paraphrase of an in-session web snapshot; no explicit abuse details retained.

1) The article describes livestreamed child sexual abuse facilitated by local perpetrators/facilitators and consumed remotely by foreign offenders, including from the UK.
2) It frames this as a “made to order” pattern: remote offenders provide real-time instructions via chat during a live session (details not retained).
3) It states livestreamed abuse is difficult to detect because it occurs in real time and uses mainstream communications platforms.
4) Platforms named as examples include WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and FaceTime.
5) It describes victim captivity/control measures (guards, threats) used by facilitators to prevent escape (details not retained).
6) It describes law-enforcement rescue operations conducted by Philippine authorities, with support from international partners in at least one described case.
7) It states offenders may pay small amounts per session and that facilitators may receive payments via “mobile phone top-ups.”
8) It describes a downstream harm pattern: the exploitation may continue after rescue if offenders record and redistribute content (details not retained).
9) It references civil-society support organization IJM describing survivor impacts and advocating for detection/prevention tools.
10) It references UK NCA identifying offenders and prosecuting/charging individuals for requesting/paying for livestream sessions (case details not retained).
