Project VIC International is a non-profit 501(c)(3) in the United States of America, EIN 83-0986212. Financial donations help us fund our mission to help enable thousands of law enforcement officers around the world who work each day to find and rescue children from sexual exploitation and abuse. Consider making a one-time or monthly donation to help us continue our mission.

We have made the Crimes Against Children (CAC) Ontology free to the world under an Apache 2 license to help break down communication silos so that every person and organization
who works to keep children safe everywhere can benefit from this work.

Please consider making a [donation](https://secure.givelively.org/donate/project-vic-international-inc) today to help sustain the CAC Ontology.
